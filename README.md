# Food_Demand_Forecasting_Machine_Learning_Nov2024

Welcome to Week 14 of the Weekly MachineHack Hackathon Series!

This week’s challenge focuses on developing a predictive model for food demand forecasting. Accurate forecasting is crucial for food supply chain management, allowing businesses to minimize waste and optimize inventory.

About the Dataset
The dataset consists of historical food demand data from various facilities, regions, and categories. You’ll analyze patterns and trends to predict future demand for food items, helping businesses make informed decisions.

Dataset Description:

Train.csv: Contains historical data with features like food items, demand quantity, and additional contextual information (e.g., promotions types).
Test.csv: The dataset for which you will generate predictions.
Submission.csv: The format for submitting your predictions.
Participation and Benefits:
Skill Level: This challenge is designed for participants with experience in time series analysis, machine learning, and data preprocessing.
Community Engagement: Join our Telegram group to connect with other participants, ask questions, and share insights.
Recognition: All participants will receive a MachineHack certificate, and top performers will be highlighted on the leaderboard.
Live Walkthrough: A live session will be held on [insert date] to guide you through the challenge and provide expert tips.
Submission and Evaluation:
Submission Format: Submit your predictions in the provided Submission.csv file.
Evaluation Metric: Submissions will be evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Leaderboard: Track your performance and strive to reach the top!
How to Approach the Challenge:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and formatting issues.
Feature Engineering: Create meaningful features that capture trends and seasonality (e.g., day of the week, month, promotions).
Modeling Techniques: Experiment with models such as ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting for time series forecasting.
Validation and Tuning: Use cross-validation techniques and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
A starter notebook will be available to guide you through the initial data preprocessing steps and basic model building.
